              <p>Our journey began when we won the Renewable Energy Technical Incubator (RETI) competition, securing more than 50,000 SAR in funding. We dedicated these funds to advancing our R&D, building a functional prototype using a small-scale machinery unit, and validating our technology. Our unique selling point, which transforms waste into value through a cost-effective and eco-friendly production process, played a key role in helping us win the competition and secure the prize.</p>

This support enables us to participate in the start-up incubator program, learn about real market supply-and-demand principles, study intellectual property, automate the machinery unit we have already developed, and conduct pilot testing for our product. We also expanded our network significantly, building strong relationships with suppliers, buyers, and investors.</p>
