# GitHub Pages Website Starter (Pure HTML)

This is a minimal, hand-editable HTML website ready for GitHub Pages.
- Each page is a real `.html` file.
- Shared header/footer are loaded client-side from `/partials/` (no build step required).
- Dummy images live in `/assets/images/` — replace them with your own anytime.

## Quick Start
1. Create a new repo named `yourusername.github.io` (or any repo for a project site).
2. Upload these files to the repo root.
3. In **Settings → Pages**, set **Source** to "Deploy from a branch", pick `main` and `/ (root)`.
4. (Optional) Add a custom domain in Pages settings, and set DNS at your registrar.

## Where to edit
- Navigation: `partials/header.html`
- Footer: `partials/footer.html`
- Styles: `assets/styles.css`
- Content pages: `index.html`, `about.html`, `team.html`, `contact.html`
- SEO: `sitemap.xml`, `robots.txt`, `<meta>` tags in each page `<head>`
